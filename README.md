# space-agnoster.zsh-theme

A very minor color tweak for [agnoster.zsh-theme](https://github.com/agnoster/agnoster-zsh-theme)
for better color/contrast for running on MacOS with Terminal, in its Pro theme and the terminal
panel in VSCode when using the 'Spacemacs - dark' color theme.

## Install

```bash
git clone git@github.com:s6o/space-agnoster-zsh-theme.git
cd space-agnoster-zsh-theme
ln -s $PWD/space-agnoster.zsh-theme ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/agnoster.zsh-theme
```
